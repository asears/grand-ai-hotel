# App Modernization Stub: .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 11

This folder provides a stub layout for a modernization walkthrough. It does not contain a real app. Use it as a template for your own .NET Framework 4.5 project.

## Layout

- `.github/upgrades/`: staged Markdown artifacts
- `grounding/`: memory, state, debug logs, and human feedback

## How to use

1. Copy your legacy app into a `src/` folder here.
2. Run the modernization assessment and record output.
3. Update plan and tasks as the work proceeds.
